In this series, we’re going to review 5 of the most popular web components tools right now - LitElement, Angular Elements, Stencil JS, Bit and Svelte JS. We’ll compare the website and documentation, community size and support and create a sample component in each. Finally we’ll sum up everything and make some recommendations on how and when to use each one.
